# Flux Framework

**Flux** is an open-source, AI-driven Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework designed for the AI age. It reimagines traditional methodologies by integrating continuous, real-time planning with AI-powered automation to streamline workflows, foster dynamic human-AI collaboration, and accelerate innovation.

## Overview

Flux transforms the software development process by:
- **Real-Time Adaptability:** Moving away from fixed iterations to an always-on development pipeline that adjusts dynamically.
- **AI-Powered Automation:** Automating routine tasks such as project planning, status updates, and backlog management.
- **Hybrid Collaboration:** Merging human strategic oversight with autonomous AI agents to optimize development and decision-making.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Integrating live data from code, testing, and user interactions for immediate actionable insights.

## Features

- **Dynamic Planning:** AI agents continuously analyze project metrics to adjust priorities in real time.
- **Automated Ceremonies:** Replace traditional stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives with AI-generated summaries and actionable insights.
- **Integrated Dashboards:** Real-time visualization of project health, quality metrics, and user feedback.
- **Seamless CI/CD Integration:** Optimizes testing, deployment, and monitoring with AI-driven recommendations.
- **Open-Source Collaboration:** Built as an open-source project to encourage community contributions, transparency, and rapid innovation.
